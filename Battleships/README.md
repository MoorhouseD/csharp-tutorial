# Battleships

Welcome to the world of battleships! We'll be making a 1v1 version of the game, initially using the console for display.

## Lesson 1 - The Game Loop

The first lesson will be around establishing the game loop. We can layout what happens in each round.
This should cover:

- How the game loop will run
- Establishing states
- How to know when the game ends
