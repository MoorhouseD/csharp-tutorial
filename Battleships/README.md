# Battleships

Welcome to the world of battleships! We'll be making a 1v1 version of the game, initially using the console for display.

## Lesson 1 - The Game Loop

The first lesson will be around establishing the game loop. We can layout what happens in each round.
This should cover:

- How the game loop will run
- Establishing states
- How to know when the game ends

### Outcome


- We established that the game will end when a finished state is reached. 
- We created a `Setup()` method that we'll use to create the grid, generate the ships, and allow players to place ships.


## Lesson 2 - Creating Ships

The second lesson will cover the creation of different types of ships.
This should cover:

- The abstract class - `Ship`
- Defining ships with inheritance
- Identifting ships with an Enum - `ShipType`
